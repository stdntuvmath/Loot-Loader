Turner Bands Concept:
i.   The Angle of the slope of a moving average = ATAN((avg1 - avg0)/(change in time = 1minute)) = arctangent(ExponentialMovAvg(closePrice, 200)_1 - ExponentialMovAvg(closePrice, 200)_0)
ii.  moves through 20 different standard deviations of the angle. The topology this creates is highly unconventional as
     many statisticians know that 99.7% of all data will always be contained in 6 standard deviations (±3) of the mean. This is known as the empirical rule of statistics.
iii. The Turner Bands are different because of the calculus involved. Intantaneously, the angle of a slope is the second derivative of the a function. As the angle moves through these standard deviations, it crosses them and they act as thresholds for buys and sells.

Additional tools used:
i.   Hooks law plays a big role in the periodic nature of the stock market. Which is interesting because the
     stock market is pushed primarily by hope, faith, and the accumulated emotions of people. Stock chart motion for 
     any particular stock is like a rubberband stretching to one high and to another low from an equalibrium point. 
     Throughout the code, you will see the name "hlev".
     hlev = Hooks Law Energy Value, because we are attempting to track the energy of the waveform created by emotions.
ii.  pms = Monthly_High - Monthly_Low is the "potential monthly swing". The center of this pms distance is made
     into an origin. origin = Monthly_Low + (Monthly_High - Monthly_Low)/2 = Monthly_Low + pms/2.
iii. hlevPercentage is the percentage of the pms that the current close is occupying. For example,
     if the close price is currently at $144.00 and the pms = Monthly_High - Monthly_Low = 150.10 - 134.00 = 16.1.
     The closePrice - Monthly_Low = 144.00 - 134.00 = 10
     The close price position relative to the pms is the hlevPercentage which is the ratio: (closePrice - Monthly_Low)/(pms)
     which would be equal to 10/16.1 = 0.62111 = 62.1%
