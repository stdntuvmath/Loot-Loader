Examples of git add
git add usually fits into the workflow in the following steps:

Create a branch: git branch update-readme
Checkout to that branch: git checkout update-readme
Change a file or files
Save the file or files
Add the files or segments of code that should be included in the next commit: git add README.md
Commit the changes: git commit -m "update the README to include links to contributing guide"
Push the changes to the remote branch: git push -u origin update-readme
But, git add could also be used like:

Create a branch: git branch update-readme
Checkout to that branch: git checkout update-readme
Change a file or files
Save the file or files
Add only one file, or one part of the changed file: git add README.md
Commit the first set of changes: git commit -m "update the README to include links to contributing guide"
Add another file, or another part of the changed file: git add CONTRIBUTING.md
Commit the second set of changes: git commit -m "create the contributing guide"
(Repeat as necessary)
Push the changes to the remote branch: git push -u origin update-readme
